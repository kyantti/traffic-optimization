    "\n",
    "> Scope: **nodes only** (cities as points). Segments/edges are handled in a separate function and are **out of scope here**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## V0 — Uniform Synthetic Nodes\n",
    "\n",
    "**Goal:** Minimal, reproducible node set in a rectangular region.\n",
    "**Inputs:** seed, N, bbox (km), population range.\n",
    "**Method:** Sample positions uniformly inside bbox; populations \\~ Uniform\\[min,max].\n",
    "**Outputs:** `id, x_km, y_km, pop`.\n",
    "**Validation:** N matches; inside bbox; pop in range.\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## V1 — City Size Classes\n",
    "\n",
    "**Goal:** Urban hierarchy.\n",
    "**Changes:** Assign `class ∈ {large, medium, small}` with quotas (e.g., 10/30/60%). Distinct lognormal per class.\n",
    "**Validation:** Class counts match; medians ordered `large > medium > small`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### V1.1 — Single-Core Density Field\n",
    "\n",

    "## V2 — Multi-Core & Corridors\n",
    "\n",
    "**Goal:** Multiple metros and directional corridors (still nodes-only).\n",
    "**Changes:** Mixture of K Gaussians; optional elongated kernels for corridors.\n",
    "**Outputs:** `core_id`.\n",
    "**Validation:** Cluster sizes near targets; inter-core gaps > intra-core.\n",
    "\n",
    "### V2.1 — Terrain Masks (Synthetic)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Goal:** Keep cities off water/mountains.\n",
    "**Changes:** Binary masks for water/mountain; reject masked samples; (optional) synthetic elevation.\n",
    "**Outputs:** `mask_violation=false`, optional `elev_m`.\n",
    "**Validation:** 0 violations; distance-to-coast summary if used.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## V3 — Administrative Regions & Quotas\n",
    "\n",
    "**Goal:** Balanced distribution by region (states/provinces).\n",
    "**Changes:** Partition bbox into R polygons; enforce per-region node and class quotas.\n",
    "**Outputs:** `region_id`.\n",
    "**Validation:** Quotas satisfied; regional population totals within tolerance.\n",
    "\n",
    "### V3.1 — Socioeconomic Attributes\n",
    "\n",
    "**Goal:** Enrich nodes for later demand models.\n",
    "**Changes:** Sample `gdp_idx`, `sector_service_pct`, `tourism_score` conditioned on class/region; allow correlation with `pop`.\n",
    "**Validation:** Correlation checks (e.g., corr(pop, gdp\\_idx) within configured band).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## V4 — Urban Extents & Footprint Radius\n",
    "\n",
    "**Goal:** Distinguish metros vs. towns (single centroid per city).\n",
    "**Changes:** Compute `urban_radius_km ~ c * pop^α`; (optional) metropolitan cluster flag if extents overlap.\n",
    "**Outputs:** `urban_radius_km`, `metro_cluster_id` (optional).\n",
    "**Validation:** Radii monotonic with population; overlap rates controlled.\n",
    "\n",
    "### V4.1 — Temporal Population Profiles\n",
    "\n",
    "**Goal:** Proto-demand without edges.\n",
    "**Changes:** Store `pop_day`, `pop_night`, `seasonality[12]` derived from class/sector mix.\n",
    "**Outputs:** `pop_base, pop_day, pop_night, seasonality[]`.\n",
    "**Validation:** Mass conservation rules per region/time.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## V5 — Calibration to Empirical Laws\n",
    "\n",
    "**Goal:** Synthetic but tuned to global regularities.\n",
    "**Changes:** Rank–size (Zipf) calibration for top K cities; spatial K‑function/nearest‑neighbor targets; simple optimizer.\n",
    "**Validation:** KS-distance (or similar) vs. targets below threshold.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## V6 — Real-World Import (Nodes-Only)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Goal:** Replace synthetic with real city centroids & populations.\n",
    "**Changes:** Import from public datasets; normalize to schema/CRS; deduplicate.\n",
    "**Outputs:** add `name, iso_code, official_pop_year`.\n",
    "**Validation:** Coverage; missing attribute rate; duplicates by name/coords.\n",
    "\n",
    "### V6.1 — Hybrid Augmentation\n",
    "\n",
    "**Goal:** Real cities + synthetic infill where data is sparse.\n",
    "**Changes:** Generate small-town infill following regional quotas/masks.\n",
    "**Validation:** Real nodes untouched; infill respects constraints.\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## V7 — Scenario Knobs (Nodes-Only)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Goal:** Parametric scenarios affecting nodes.\n",
    "**Changes:** Regional/class growth factors; activation flags; new-town scenarios.\n",
    "**Outputs:** `scenario_id, active_flag, pop_scenario`.\n",
    "**Validation:** Delta reports per scenario; reproducibility via seed+config.\n",

    "## Common Standards (Applies Across Versions)\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Schema (SV 1.x):** `id, x_km, y_km, pop` plus optional fields (`class, core_id, region_id, gdp_idx, tourism_score, urban_radius_km, ...`).\n",
    "* **CRS:** Prefer a clear declaration. For synthetic boxes use `LOCAL_KM`; for real-world data adopt `EPSG:4326` or `EPSG:3857` and align units/fields.\n",
    "* **Reproducibility:** Persist seed + full YAML config in `meta.json`.\n",
    "* **Validation Pack:** node count, bounds, spacing, class quotas, pop percentiles, mask violations, calibration metrics.\n",
    "* **Preview:** Scatter sized by `pop`, optionally colored by `class/core/region`, with legend.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Changelog Discipline\n",
    "\n",
    "* **schema\\_version (SV):** bump when columns/semantics/units change.\n",
    "* **dataset\\_version (DV):** bump for content changes under same schema (seed/params).\n",

    "> Tip: Name output directories like `maps/sv1.0/dv0.3_v2_multicore_k3` so datasets are self-describing and easy to diff.\n"
